# API Endpoints

This section documents the REST APIs used in the service-oriented monolithic architecture. Each endpoint is mapped to a functional requirement to demonstrate traceability between requirements and implementation.

## Functional Requirements (Proof-of-Concept Scope)

- **FR-01:** Users can register and log in to the system
- **FR-02:** Users can submit complaints linked to a company
- **FR-03:** Users can view and track their complaints
- **FR-04:** Help desk / support staff can assign, escalate, and resolve complaints
- **FR-05 (Partial / Design-level):** Complaints can be managed per company
- **FR-06 (Design-level):** Notifications are supported by architecture but not fully implemented
